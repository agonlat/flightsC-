Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_custom_item_delegate}{Custom\+Item\+Delegate}} \\*Extends QStyled\+Item\+Delegate and is used for painting the table which shows the flights. The table is a QTable\+View }{\pageref{class_custom_item_delegate}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_data_manipulator}{Data\+Manipulator}} \\*Provies convenient methods to manipulate data in the current flights table. You are able to set a new intern time, new terminal, new status, new position and you can provide a label with the flight information. Specifically, the label is located in the "{}\+Flug Ã¤ndern"{} section, so in the Dialog, where you can change a flight. And the Dialog is implemented in mainwindow.\+cpp }{\pageref{class_data_manipulator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_file_handler}{File\+Handler}} \\*Methods to read a csv file, to show flights and to export the current flights as csv-\/fromat }{\pageref{class_file_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structflights}{flights}} \\*This struct holds the neccesary attributes of a flight }{\pageref{structflights}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_main_window}{Main\+Window}} \\*Operates as the class where nearly all main operations are executed. In this class there also the slots defined and the connection methods, which connect a signal with a slot }{\pageref{class_main_window}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_time_handler}{Time\+Handler}} \\*Various methods for time operations }{\pageref{class_time_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_utility_methods}{Utility\+Methods}} \\*Convenient helper methods, which are needed for other operations }{\pageref{class_utility_methods}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator}} \\*Methods to check various strings, if they are valid, such as flight number or control number, intern time and the position }{\pageref{class_validator}}{}
